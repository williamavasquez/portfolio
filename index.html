		<!--  Born in NJ, USA but raised in Lima, Peru (home of the best ceviche in the world), I hold a MBA from Universidad del Pacifico in Peru and BS. from Ramapo College in NJ. I was luckly enough to be able to study and learn from both countries. 

		My love for cooking comes from eating the best food on the planet.. Peruvian. There is were I also learned to play soccer, my second passion. Actually it would be my third, my Wife beats soccer, but looses to eating and cooking. 

		Technology and computers have to be on this list  I hold close to my heart. I was able to grow this curisoity thanks to having a Computer back when Floppy 3/4  was a thing... Still remeber my parents trying to open programs on MSDos.
