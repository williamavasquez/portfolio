				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<img src="img/william_vasquez.jpg">
				<p>Born in NJ, USA but raised in Lima, Peru (home of the best ceviche in the world), I hold a MBA from Universidad del Pacifico in Peru and BS. from Ramapo College in NJ. I was luckly enough to be able to study and learn from both countries. </br></br>

				My love for cooking comes from eating the best food on the planet.. Peruvian. There is were I also learned to play soccer, my second passion. Actually it would be my third, my Wife beats soccer, but looses to eating and cooking. </br></br>

				Technology and computers have to be on this list  I hold close to my heart. I was able to grow this curisoity thanks to having a Computer back when Floppy 3/4  was a thing... Still remeber my parents trying to open programs on MSDos
